# Risk-Dice-Roller
This program simply rolls the dices the Risk for you - with results 
 - With Blitz mode the attacking player can just enter the amount of soldiers he has and the program fights them off until there are none left
 Since a player has to move all Troops which he rolled for, when playing with Blitz mode the player must move 3 of the remaining troops - in a case in which less than 3 Troops survive The player must move all of his remaining troops (not including the one which stays to defend)
